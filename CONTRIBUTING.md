# Contribution Guide for data-structures-all-langs

Thank you for taking time out to learn the best practices for contributing to this repo! Your contributions will potentially help thousands of developers on their journeys to understand data structures intuitively. Please, read through carefully and feel free to open an issue if something is not clear.

# Before you start coding

If you are interested in contributing a feature, please [file an issue first](https://github.com/arausly/algo-rhymes/issues/new). Wait for a project maintainer to respond before you spend time coding.

If you wish to work on an existing issue, please add a comment saying so, as someone may already be working on it. A project maintainer may respond with advice on how to get started.

As a contributor you can:

- Implement a data structure in a language that doesn't exist
- Improve any implementation
- Improve the READMEs explaining any data structure (NO SPAMS, PLS)

## Adding/Editing a Coding File

- Coding file should be created a directory that looks like `algo-ryhmes/diffculty/name_of_problem/solutions/programming.language/name.of.file`
- Add a readme explaining your solution to the question
- Add driver code (i.e. code in the "main" function to test the implementation)
